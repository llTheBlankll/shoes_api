### Problem:

---
I have a problem. In features table for products, the value can either be String or Integer.
But since it is not possible to have a both data type in MySQL, I made it VARCHAR(255).
So here is the problem, using spring boot, I can't perform the less and greater than operation on varchar
even if the value is an integer but a string like "14".
How can I perform a greater and less than sql query using spring boot?

### Solution

---
This is one of the common issue when dealing with flexible data types in a
relational database like MySQL or MariaDB. Since I am using Spring Boot,
I can use a custom query with a CAST function to convert the `value` column
to an integer when performing the comparison.

Of course, if the value of the column has any other data type, such as
letters or dates, it won't work and will throw an error. To fix this, you
To mitigate these issues, you can add additional checks or data validation
to ensure that the value column only contains numeric data. In this case,
I have to make sure that the value of the `value` column is an integer using
Spring Boot.

Here is a sample query that uses the CAST function to convert the `value` column
```java
public interface FeatureRepository extends JpaRepository<Feature, Long> {

    @Query("SELECT f FROM Feature f WHERE CAST(f.value AS integer) > :value")
    List<Feature> findFeaturesGreaterThan(@Param("value") int value);

    @Query("SELECT f FROM Feature f WHERE CAST(f.value AS integer) < :value")
    List<Feature> findFeaturesLessThan(@Param("value") int value);
}
```

Everything is going well.  
Tomorrow I will work on this again if I do have time.
